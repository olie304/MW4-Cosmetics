# MW4-Cosmetics

# DISCONTINUED!
Since the developer of Greyhound [rage quit](https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound/blob/e6ab19a6de4b16663cf9d4fdcdf06eb6151c4d59/README.md) it is no longer possible to maintain this repo as I have no interest with continuing the Greyhound project. The assets in the repo should be from around Seasons 0-3

Image gallery of every cosmetic that can be earned, purchased or used by employees (Not a cheat or exploit). There are plenty of interesting things that aren't released yet or are hidden from normal players.
* Navigate to each of the directories to see a gallery
* If you try to scroll down too fast GitHub will glitch out
* Animated calling cards and emblems are in a subdirectory
* For animated stuff there is a batch script that converts all the sprite sheets into gifs using ImageMagick
